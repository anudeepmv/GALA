Developing a college website to know about the Daily events and updates  The user interface starts with the Login page , if you are a fresh member we need to signup first , In signup information we need to fill some basic details name, email id , last name , University name etc. There are two types of login one is admin and the others are students who are users.The user interface(UI) looks different for Admin and students. For admins they can create an Activity or event  with the Time, description, activity type, posters, photos and the products. The admin can create the Activity ,edit or delete the Activity. He has the Authority to Join or Remove the students in any event.In Student user interface they can view the Activity List or the events happening on the particular day with posters and information listed below the Event.They can join or disjoin the event or activity in which they are interested in.The Joined activities will be displayed on the Right of the Screen.The students will have the chat option to chat to people in the events who joined and communicate with each other to participate and forms teams if required.The user can also purchase the product from the activity and do the chat with the activity.This website helps to be pro active in all the events and activities and helps to build the communication with each other and explore new cultures and arts in what they are interested in and show case their talent.
